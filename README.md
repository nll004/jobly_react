# Jobly
Springboard Software Engineering BootCamp - Cohort Jan 2022 
Project started: Jan 2023

## About 
Jobly is a simple mock job board that allows the user to create an account, view jobs/companies and one click apply to a job posting. 

##Assignment 
I was given a backend API and instructed to build the user interface with react.js. I needed to create login/signup functionality, allow viewing and searching jobs or companies, as well as provide CRUD functionality for user data. [Jobly_API](https://github.com/nll004/express_API_jobly) is the backend I built previously for this project. We did not use our backend code base for this project however. The backend we were given for this UI was more robust and also generates mock jobs and companies.  

##Technologies Used
- React.js
- Html5
- CSS
- React Router
- Axios
